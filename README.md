As part of the codebasics resume challenge, I have worked on this analysis project.

## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. 

### Task List

Here is where I come into the picture— I used the historical data to build the Dashboard for AtliQ Grands.

## Learnt the following things from this project:
- By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60% to 90% of the booking cost.
- Used a particular color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard.
- Domain Knowledge in Hospitality Sector including Important KPIs, such as: RevPAR, DSRN, DBRN, DURN etc.

## Some Important insights from the Dashboard

- Mumbai generated the highest revenue (669 M) followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi.
- AtliQ Exotica performs better compared to all 7 type of properties with 320 Million revenue, rating 3.62, occupancy percentage 57 and cancellation rate as 24.3%.
- AtliQ Blu has the highest occupancy rate of 62%.
- Week 29 recorded the highest revenue amongst all, which is 139.73 Million.
- Delhi tops both in occupancy and rating followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore.
- Elite type rooms has the most booking and as well as the highest cancellation rate.
